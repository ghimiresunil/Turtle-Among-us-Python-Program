# Turtle Among Us

## Introduction 

When I was a kid, I used to learn logo design, picture design, and graphic design. “Turtle” which is a Python special feathers like a drawing board helped me to learn code and introduced to graphics by the Python Turtle. I remember that I was fascinated by this library.  In the initial phase, this was what made me interested in programming and feel like a computer genius when I control a little object on my computer screen. So, I spent the entire night learning new stuff about it at the one-week camp. A similar interactive feature is supported in the Python Turtle Library that offers Python a taste of what it’s like to deal with new programmers. Today in this tutorial, I am going to show something really beautiful as well as an amazing program that you can do using a Turtle in python to build an Avatar of Among Us.

NOTE: Make sure that you have Python version 3 or above on your computer. If not, you will be able to download it from the _**Python website**_.

## In this tutorial, you will:

* Understand what is the Python Turtle Library
* Learn how to set up a turtle on your computer/laptop
* Program with the library of Python Turtle
* Grasp some key concept of turtle command and Python
* Develop an entertaining and short avatar of Among Us game using what you’ve learned

While creating Avatar of Among us, we can use functions that can move the turtle around, such as **turtle.down(...)**, **turtle.right(...)**, and **turtle.forward(...)**. Some commonly used turtle methods are listed below:-
